PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

This Python script is a professional and user-friendly tool designed to fetch real-time weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API and visualize it using Matplotlib. It prompts the user to enter a city name, then sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap 5-day/3-hour forecast API endpoint with the city name and a valid API key. The script includes robust error handling to manage connectivity issues, invalid city names, or API response errors gracefully.

When a successful response is received, the script extracts and parses temperature data for every 3-hour interval from the JSON forecast. It converts timestamps from strings into Python datetime objects, making it easier to plot and format the x-axis. The data is visualized as a line chart showing temperature trends over time, with rotated date labels for readability, grid lines for clarity, and descriptive titles and axis labels. This results in a clean, informative visualization dashboard.

Key features include a modular design with separated functions for fetching data and plotting, promoting code maintainability and reusability. The script relies on minimal, widely used dependencies—requests for HTTP calls and matplotlib for visualizations—that are straightforward to install. Its interactive flow makes it suitable for users wanting immediate weather insights for any city globally.

This script serves as a solid foundation for weather data analysis projects and can be extended to more complex dashboards using libraries like Seaborn or interactive frameworks such as Dash or Streamlit. By combining API data retrieval, JSON parsing, and effective visualization, this code exemplifies practical skills in API integration and data visualization while adhering to best practices for clarity, robustness, and user experience. It is ideal for developers or analysts who require both programmatic access to public weather data and dynamic graphical representation of the collected information.
